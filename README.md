# Link in Bio

This is a website to direct people to the relevant links in bio inspired by the popular linktree website.
Rather than using a custom domain and pay for a service annually, I have chosen to explore the use of Github's Pages option.
This was an exploration in to understanding html and css as well as responsive web design.

Key Features:
- Resizable and responsive website design for web and mobile design
- Using only HTML and CSS
- Explores custom CSS Tags
- Explores Media queries for responsive screen sizes

The website can be viewed at :
